  </ul> </div><br /><divclass="row"><div class="col-xs-30"><span class="text-center"><h3>"I once asked [Jobs] why he gets so mad about stuff. He said, "But I don't stay mad." He has this very childish ability to get really worked up about something, and it doesn't stay with him at all. But, there are other times, I think honestly, when he's very frustrated, and his way to achieve catharsis is to hurt somebody. And I think he feels he has a liberty and license to do that. The normal rules of social engagement, he feels, don't apply to him. Because of how very sensitive he is, he knows exactly how to efficiently and effectively hurt someone. And he does do that."</h3></span></div><br/><em>         <p align="center"> -Bill Gates</p></em></div><div class="text-center"><h2>If you have time, you should read more about this incredible human being on his <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" target="_blank" id="target1">Wikipedia entry</a></h2></div></div></div>
